# C0-Compiler

Development Environment: C++11, Clang 8.0.1
Project Overview: This project implements a compiler for a source language that is a subset similar to C, targeting the MIPS assembly language. It supports error handling and uses recursive descent parsing for syntax analysis. The compiler includes optimizations such as constant propagation and common subexpression elimination.
